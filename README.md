# Our Project 

The mental well-being of a person is difficult to analyze normally, write your unwavering thoughts and assess your mental health by receiving daily as well as combined progressive analysis about your mental health which will help you in tracking your progress. For the past two years, the COVID-19 Pandemic has drastically changed our lives and made it monotonous by restricting us to our homes.
It is very difficult to harness the raw emotions a person feels during having mental health issues. Therapy can be a very intimidating process for many people especially in starting sessions with the therapist and it makes putting out your raw emotions and all the thoughts in your head a challenge.

Any Individual can maintain their personalized diary where their daily emotions will be recorded through write-up/voice input.
The diary will be analyzed on a daily basis by the bots and will provide feasible and instant solutions according to the problem. Therapy sessions will be provided on weekly basis based on analysis. An unique feature of tracking user's daily goals will be added by which points can be earned and can be converted into money which one can use for reduce in therapists session.
